Overview

J is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is particularly suited to the mathematical, statistical, and logical analysis of data. It is a powerful tool for developing algorithms and exploring problems that are not already well understood.

J is written in portable C and is available for Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android and Raspberry Pi. J can be installed and distributed for free. The source is provided under both commercial and GPL 3 licenses.

J is easy to install, has a small footprint, and has direct access to tutorials and documentation.

The latest release is 807. A 901 beta with several performance improvements is available from April 2019.

Jd ( J database) is a high-performance columnar RDBMS written in J that is geared toward storing and analyzing large amounts of data. Jd is free for non-commercial use.

Jd lives openly and dynamically in the J execution and development environment, so that the full power of J is available to the application developer. For example, Jd columns are mapped to J nouns, so built-in J primitives can apply directly to the data.

It works well with large tables (millions of rows to billions), multiple tables connected by joins, structured data, numerical data, and complex queries and aggregations.

Documentation can be found in the wiki and in html files on the website and addons. Most newer material is on the wiki, while the older html pages are still valid. The wiki also has a wealth of community supported material.

Forums (mailing lists) give life to the community. They are the best way to get help, help others, report bugs, and share your interests. All serious J users should at least subscribe to the programming forum.

As well as the J forums, the Stack Overflow J tag is useful for focused questions.
